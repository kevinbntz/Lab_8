        "Description": "The Albee Square Mall was a prominent indoor shopping center on Fulton Street that was in operation from 1977 to 2007. Replacing the Albee Theater in the same spot, the mall was home to 50 local businesses and was a hotspot for Brooklyn teenagers who hung out for hours at a time during and after school. While the mall was known for its basketball jerseys, stands that offered underground mixtapes, and Bally sneakers at Gibb's, Orange Julius was the most popular attraction. \"That's where all the hood cats would hang out,\" remarked Big Daddy Kane. \"We'd take the train up to Midtown and all meet over at Orange Julius. It was like a hangout spot for all the teenagers,\". Albee Square Mall was most famously memorialized in rapper Biz Markie's \"Albee Square Mall\", which was released years after his famous rap battle with Big Daddy Kane in the same place. Yet thanks to the upzoning of Downtown Brooklyn in 2004, the mall was razed to the ground in 2007 and replaced with City Point, a luxury mixed-use multi-building residential and commercial complex.",

        "Description": "Marcy Houses is a Bedford-Stuyvesant New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) development that birthed the career of Jay-Z, one of the greatest rappers of all time. Jay-Z was raised at Marcy Houses, and as a preteen, he came across several kids in the hallways of his building at rapping in a cypher. He went home and wrote his first verses that night. Hip-hop was exploding across New York in the 1980s, and Marcy was no exception. As Vice describes, \"speakers and subwoofers eight feet in height would be set up in the courtyards of the Marcy Houses for epic MC battles that would 'rattle' the windows of the families\" in the projects above.\n\nJay-Z references Brooklyn, Marcy Houses, and his neighborhood Bedford-Stuyvesant 67 times across his catalog of songs. In this excerpt, Jay-Z describes the invisibility of ghettoized[link to redlining guide] neighborhoods in the 1980s, the drug trade, urban poverty and the struggle for economic mobility, and militarized police infiltrating black neighborhoods during the War on Drugs. These references provide a rich oral history of Marcy Houses in the height of the crack epidemic."

        "Description": "Myrtle & Broadway is a prominent intersection on the border between Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, notable for its elevated subway station. This commercial pocket is lively well into the night with street vendors, bodegas, and fastfood eateries. Although this is a historically black neighborhood, as described by Mos Def, this chaotic transportation hub has become become a symbol of gentrification in recent years. As younger white populations moved into the Bushwick and Bed-Stuy neighborhoods, the stop has become emblematic of the chasms that emerge in New York neighborhoods due to gentrification, as high-end coffee shops and white collar workers move in alongside street vendors, migrants, and longstanding black residents.\n\nMos Def's reference to the pipeline from black communities to prisons strongly resonates at the Myrtle-Broadway intersection, as the Manhattan Detention Complex is just a few stops away. Subway tracks rumbling overhead, the Sumner Houses, and Woodhull Hospital loom as a reminder that carcerality can extend beyond prison walls and into redlined neighborhoods."

        "Description": "Nkiru was the first and longest-running black bookstore in Brooklyn. It was originally located at 76 Marks Ave, and for much of the 1990's, the bookshop was a hub for Brooklyn's black literary community. As the Village Voice describes, the bookshop ushered in \"a new vanguard of African-American poets, authors, and rappers. Nkiru nurtured a modern renaissance of radical black thought and spoken word in New York City,\" launching the careers of writers like Edwidge Danticat, Saul Williams, and many others. The shop was founded in 1976 by Leothy Miller Owens to supply low-income children in Brooklyn with multicultural books. The bookshop hosted readings by famed authors like Maya Angelou, Octavia Butler, and Alice Walker.\n\nTalib Kweli grew up 5 blocks from Nkiru, walking by the store almost daily as a kid. When he was a student at NYU, he worked at Nkiru Books. Kweli told the Village Voice in 2016, \"I would have killed and died for that place. I felt like I was home.\" As Mos Def and Talib Kweli's rap careers began to take off, they launched a hip-hop event called \"Foundations\" at Nkiru that turned the shop into a revolutionary performing arts space for emerging rappers and spoken word poets. In the late 1990s, when Nkiru was struggling financially, Talib Kweli and Mos Def purchased the shop to save it. Nkiru relocated to Prospect Heights under the new ownership, but ultimately closed in 2002. Kweli has since opened an online version of Nkiru Books.",
